This site exists as an exploration of database technologies of all forms, primarially from the point of view of a developer working with the technology but also touching on many other concepts, such as deployment, hosting, performance engineering, testing and so on.

There is no limit to the database technologies that will be discussed here, but primarially I will be focusing on the technologies that are less discussed elsewhere, as I feel these have much more of interest to explore.
